Cloak and Dagger is a 2D stealth platformer. You control Lucinda, a thief that
needs to prove her worth in a series of missions. Each mission contains
objectives that involve theft, sabotage, or assassination. Each mission also
pits Lucinda against a garrison of guards that are guaranteed to kill her if
confronted directly. Instead, she must seek to avoid them, outwit them, or stab
them in the back.
