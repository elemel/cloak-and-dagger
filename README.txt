Cloak and Dagger is a 2D stealth platformer. You control Lucinda, a thief that
needs to prove her worth to the Siblinghood by completing a series of
contracts. Each mission pits Lucinda against a garrison of guards that are
guaranteed to kill her if confronted directly. Instead, she must seek to avoid
them, outwit them, or ambush them.
