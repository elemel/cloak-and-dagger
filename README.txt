Cloak and Dagger is a 2D stealth platformer. You control Lucinda, a thief that
needs to prove her worth in a series of missions. Each mission contains
objectives that involve theft, sabotage, or assassination. Each mission also
pits you against a garrison of guards that must be avoided, outwitted, or
backstabbed.
